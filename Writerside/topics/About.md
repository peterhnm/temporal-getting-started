# About Temporal Getting Started

This project is an initial exploration of **Temporal** — a microservice orchestration 
platform designed for building reliable, scalable, and long-running distributed 
applications — approached from the perspective of someone experienced with **BPMN** 
(Business Process Model and Notation).  
The objective is to bridge the gap between BPMN modeling and Temporal’s code-first 
workflow orchestration, by modeling familiar BPMN concepts and implementing them using 
Temporal.

To start, I’ve modeled a simple BPMN process and will gradually enhance it over time, 
implementing each step using Temporal’s workflow and activity constructs. 
The goal is to explore how common workflow and process patterns can be expressed and 
executed within the Temporal framework.

The next chapter, [Concepts of Temporal](Concept.md), provides a brief overview of 
Temporal’s core architecture and building blocks.  
In the chapters that follow, I will focus on implementing the workflow step by step, 
highlighting how each part maps to familiar BPMN constructs.
