# About Temporal Getting Started

This project is a first exploration of Temporal – a microservice orchestration platform 
designed for running reliable, scalable, and long-lived distributed applications – from 
the perspective of someone familiar with BPMN. 
The goal is to model and implement familiar BPMN concepts using Temporal, exploring how 
common workflow and process patterns can be represented within the Temporal framework.
